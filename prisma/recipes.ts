Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a perky simmer and cook for 1¼ hours or until the chicken is just about falling off the bones. Remove the chicken from the pot, while leaving the stock to simmer on a low heat. Remove the meat from the chicken, putting the skin and carcass back into the stock. Chop the chicken into 1-2cm pieces and store, covered in the fridge. Simmer the stock, uncovered for a further 30 minutes, sieve to remove all the extra bits which you can now discard, and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.",

Cook for 1 minute then add 1 cup of stock and whisk to form a smoothish paste. Whisk in a remaining stock and add the soup mix. Add the reserved chicken and stir in.

Repeat until you have used all the chicken mix – you should have 12-13 croquettes. Whisk the eggs in a flat-bottomed bowl and one by one, dip the croquettes in the egg and roll again in breadcrumbs.
